Code pipeline for my honor thesis project (Summer 2024- Spring 2025): 
- Video-based quantitative analysis of orofacial movements and pupil activity in a Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Mouse Model
Three main branches of analysis (work in progress):
- Facial motion energy (FME) and Eigenface (Principle components of face movement) calculation
- Pupil diameter inference from Deep Lab Cut (DLC) output
- Nose and mouth movement pattern using DLC output
